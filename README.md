# DOE and adaptive DOE
Scripts to use Bayesian optimization for adaptive DOE assuming the real situation. The base codes are for 1 variable and 2 variable functions but can be extended to multiple variable functions. Update the best gaussian kernel each time when fit the latest experiment data. Also, custom design is shown to reasonably select variable sets that have least correlations with each other for any experiment conditions and for any number of experiments you want.
